- Run `echo $SHELL` in iTerm2 to make sure you're using `bash`
- Clone this project to anywhere locally, cd into it and then run `install.sh` script for you corresponding operating systems:

1. `install-os-x.sh` for OS X
2. `install-yum.sh` for *nix systems using yum as package management tools like CentOS, Fedora, RHEL and etc.
3. `install-apt-get.sh` for *nix using apt-get as PMT like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and etc.

## Why tube-vim
I started this project when I was working on a Yahoo! Japan's audience data pipeline project, which is internally named **Tube**. Since I used most of the settings from within thie repo for that project, later I renamed this as tube-vim for a memorial.
